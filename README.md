# AIR Tunisia 2019 🏆💯🏅
Code Solution for machine learning problems solved in AI Hackathon of Tunisia.

# Requirments  ✅
in order to use, execute the code in the repository youi will be needing python enviroment, I prefer using anaconda with XGBoost and LightGBM models.

# Model Used 📈
In the Tunis air problem we used the LightGBM model without grid search, and in the Startup we used CNN model which called DenseNet, pretrained on the ImageNet Dataset

# Conclusion ‍💻
Really define the problem, not the solution.
Virtual collaboration is possible.
It’s all about building teams.
